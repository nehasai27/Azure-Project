            <hr>
          
<p style="align-content: stretch;">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. 

The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance.

The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.</p>

The first case of COVID-19 in India was reported on January 30, 2020; the index patient was a student
              who had returned from Wuhan. Thereafter, only 2 more cases were reported in February. Subsequently,
              more cases came to the forefront in the month of March and there has been a surge in the number of
              cases since the latter half of April 2020 . As of June 9, 2020, according to the Ministry of
              Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), a total of 266 598 confirmed COVID-19 cases have been reported from
              32 states/union territories.
 Most of the cases have been reported from the states of Maharashtra,
              Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and Gujarat. Hitherto, the MoHFW have reported 7471 deaths due to COVID-19, translating
              into a case-fatality rate of 2.8%.
The COVID-19 pandemic in India is a part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
              caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of 27 September 2021, according
              to official figures,
              India has the second-highest number of confirmed cases in the world (after the United States of America)
              with 33,678,786 reported
              cases of COVID-19 infection and the third-highest number of COVID-19 deaths (after the United States and
              Brazil) at 479,133 deaths.
              However these figures exhibit severe under-reporting.
              The first cases of COVID-19 in India were reported on 30 January 2020 in three towns of Kerala, among
              three Indian medical students
              who had returned from Wuhan, the epicenter of the pandemic. Lockdowns were announced in Kerala on 23
              March, and in the rest of the country on 25 March. On 10 June, India's recoveries exceeded active cases
              for the first time.Infection rates started to drop in September, along with the number of new and active
              cases. Daily cases peaked mid-September with over 90,000 cases reported per-day,
              dropping to below 15,000 in January 2021.A second wave beginning in March 2021 was much more devastating
              than the first, with shortages of vaccines, hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and other medical supplies in
              parts of the country.[16] By late April, India led the world in new and active cases. On 30 April 2021, it
              became the first country to report over 400,000 new cases in a 24-hour period.
              Experts stated that the virus may reach an endemic stage in India rather than completely disappear; in
              late August 2021, Soumya Swaminathan said India may be in some stage of endemicity where the country
              learns to live with the virus.
              India began its vaccination programme on 16 January 2021 with AstraZeneca vaccine (Covishield) and the
              indigenous Covaxin.Later, Sputnik V and the Moderna vaccine was approved for emergency use too. As of 17
              August 2021, the country had administered over 550 million vaccine doses.On 21 October 2021, at 9:47 AM
              according to the Co-WIN portal, India crossed 100 crore (1 billion) doses</p><hr>
